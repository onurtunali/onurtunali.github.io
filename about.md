Onur Tunali is a self-taught machine learning engineer with a strong background in quantitative fields, randomized algorithms, basic computational research and has extensive track record of publications in prestigious CS journals. 

Before dropping out of PhD, he has worked as a researcher in [Emerging Circuits and Computation Group (ECC)](https://www.ecc.itu.edu.tr) for more than 5 years which is a leading laboratory in the field of cutting edge computational nanoelectronics and reliability of nano-crossbar arrays residing in Istanbul Technical University. His main responsibilities consisted of designing novel algorithms, implementation and comparison of existing methods and pushing the state of the art. 

As an educational background, he has received
 
- a BSc in **Mathematics** from [Istanbul
  University](https://www.istanbul.edu.tr/en/),
- an Associated Degree in **Securities and Capital Markets** from [Anatolian
  University](https://www.anadolu.edu.tr/en) and 
- an MSc in **Nanoscience and Nanoengineering** from [Istanbul Technical
  University](http://global.itu.edu.tr/).


He as a researcher were part of  **"Synthesis and Reliability Analysis of Nano Switching Arrays"** project from 2013 through 2016 and prestigious European Union Horizon 2020 project **"NanoxComp, Synthesis and Performance Optimization of a Switching Nano-Crossbar Computer"** from 2016 through 2018. He has published several papers in reputable [conferences and journals](/publications). 

For the last couple of years, he has been working as a machine learning engineer in e-commerce sector regarding Entity resolution, product matching, semantic search problems in the field of Nature Language Processing (NLP) and focusing on productionizing deep learning models specifically transformers.
