    "# Bounds of Empirical Rademacher Complexity and Its Implications to Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, Rademacher complexity is used to measure the capacity of a hypothesis class from which utilized algorithm chooses its predictors and probably first proposed in [1]. In computational learning theory, it is possible to bound generalization loss by way of using data dependent rademacher complexity under certain assumptions. This is helpful in terms of studying  and deciding the *learnability* of a problem. However, when it comes to deep learning recent findings somewhat challenge the status quo of previous claim [2] which will be covered in later sections. Before diving into formal treatment, an informal example and explanation is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a classification problem. Chosen machine learning algorithm selects its predictor function from a hypothesis class $ h \\in \\mathcal{H}$ such that $h : \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. Since the task in question is classification, $h : \\mathcal{X} \\to \\{-1,+1\\}$. So provided a training data set $\\mathcal{D} = \\{x_{1},..,x_{N}\\}$, our ideal predictor should output $ h(x) = -1$ if input $x$ is not a member of class and $h(x) = +1$ if it is. Because we are unaware of underlying distribution, at first an $ \\mathcal{H}$ consists of $h$'s producing $1$ for every instance of $x$ is chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since size of training data is $N$, total number of data instance assignments is $2^{N}$. Therefore, our preferred $\\mathcal{H}$ would yield a correct classification at the rate of $ 1 / 2^{N}$ since it classifies every instance as $+1$. Considering this example, Rademacher complexity formally measures the capacity of $\\mathcal{H}$ such that how many of these assignments (of course in reality these assignments follow a distribution) can be classified correctly by $\\mathcal{H}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:** Combinatorics proof is rather strained and verbose. Nevertheless, the merit of combinatorics proof underlies its explanation of how an overly complicated hypothesis class is able to memorize (shatter in VC terminology) all instances of given data set. \n"

At most it is $N$ and at least it is $-N$. So we can generalize the value of $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}~ \\sigma_{i}^{(j)}~h_{i}$ in terms of mismatches between given $\\sigma^{(j)}$ and $h$. If there are $k$ mismatches, total sum would be $(N-k) \\times +1 + k \\times -1 = N - 2k$ and there would be $\\binom{N}{k}$ different cases of $k$ mismatches. Remembering the fact that $\\sigma$'s contain all possible binary distributions, we can rewrite (2.2) as the sum of $0$ mismatches through $N$ mismatches. \n",

However, it is known that deep neural networks generalize well despite the fact that they are shown to be able to even memorize random data in [2].
