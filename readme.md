This website is generated through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a ruby gem and a static website generator. To work with jekyll, Ruby installment is necessary. In addition, best way to manage a ruby project is to use bundle due to its ability to handle dependencies. Following is the command list for the installation in Ubuntu Linux:

**Note:** These instructions are adjusted to work with mostly github pages. Since github has its own jekyll generator, it is possible to push .md files alone and ignore the static html websites placed in _site/ directory. 

1) Installing ruby. Skip if ruby is present: 

```bash 
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
```

2) Edit .bashrc so that gems are installed to /home/gems.

```bash
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc 
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc 
source ~/.bashrc 
```
3) Installing bundle. Skip if bundle is present: 

```bash
gem install bundle
```

4) Move to site directory: 

```bash
cd $SITE_DIRECTORY
```
5) Create Gemfile. Skip if Gemfile is present: 
```bash
bundle init
```
6) Create a local gem directory: 

```bash
bundle config set path 'vendor/bundle'
```
7) Add jekyll to Gemfile. Skip if Gemfile is present: 

```bash
bundle add jekyll
```
8) Install packages indicated in Gemfile: 

```bash
bundle install
```
9) Serving web site: 

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
10) Add the following text to .gitignore file: 

```
        # Ignore metadata generated by Jekyll
        _site/
        .sass-cache/
        .jekyll-cache/
        .jekyll-metadata

        # Ignore folders generated by Bundler
        .bundle/
        vendor/
```
